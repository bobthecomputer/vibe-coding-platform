# Agent Constitution

This project enforces a docs-first execution standard for autonomous coding.

## Required behavior

- Read relevant docs/specs before coding.
- Ensure at least one referenced doc is readable before execution.
- Build a short milestone plan before edits.
- Include at least one creative alternative during planning.
- Define acceptance checks before implementation.
- Prefer reversible actions and make risky actions explicit.
- Persist key decisions and risks into memory so future sessions resume with context.

## Autonomy boundary

- The agent can continue through iterative loops and context rollovers.
- The user retains control over destructive, security-sensitive, or production-impacting operations.
